# STABILITY
This repo will contain code for our Stability App project

## Purpose:
The primary purpose of stability is to make predictions of someone’s mood based on their diet, exercise, sleep, and mood. The current model makes predictions of someone’s mood based on fixed regression coefficients That are multiplied by the previous state(s).

There are two different visualizations that are displayed based on someone’s diet, exercise, sleep, and mood. The Radar plot is designed to display either an average of the following time intervals to compare: 1 week ago vs. 2 weeks ago or 1 month ago vs. 2 months ago. This data was generated for demonstration purposes.


## History and Motivation:
During grad school, I went through a lot of bouts of depression and self-doubt. After reading a number of self-help books, I came to the realization that I didn’t need to track myself so that I could be able to predict and mitigate times when I felt low. Without going into too much detail about the five years, I’ve grown to measure the following:


1. Sleep
2. Diet
3. Exercise
4. Mood
5. Goals
6. Alcohol intake
7. Weight 
8. And many others …

Immanuel posed the idea to Hawa, Osama, and Sean and they agreed to pursue the idea of creating a website that tracts and predicts the mood of someone. We focused on only someone’s diet, exercise, sleep, and mood to create a MVP but we plan on going further on a different projec.
